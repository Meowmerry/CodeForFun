// --------------  LOOP ----------------
// A for loop contains three expressions separated by ; inside the parentheses:
// 1 > an initialization starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable.
// 2 > a stopping condition is the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated againstâ€” if the condition evaluates to true the code block will run, and if it evaluates to false the code will stop.
// 3 > an iteration statement is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.

for (let counter = 0; counter < 4; counter++) {
  console.log(counter);
}

// Write your code below
for (let count = 5; count <= 10; count++) {
  console.log(count);
}

//Looping in Reverse
// The loop below loops from 0 to 3. Edit it to loop backwards from 3 to 0
for (let counter = 3; counter >= 0; counter--) {
  console.log(counter);
}
